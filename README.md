### About

This quiz game was created as a method for studying Javascript array and string prototype terms. When beginning to learn Javascript, it is easy to forget what certain prototype methods do, whether that be the changes they make, if they are mutators, or if the values they return. My goal is that by playing this game, remembering those little differences will be second nature.

### Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- JSX
- Sass

### Enhancements

 - More prototype methods as well as other Javascript categories to practice
 - The option to set your own time to complete
